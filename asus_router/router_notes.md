Initially I attempted to boot to Kali Linux image using the "Kali Linux RPi" from the below Offensive Security link. However, this proved unsuccessful as the keyboard and mouse functionality refused to corporate correctly. After testing all equipment on separate hardware I was forced to flash another sd card with Noobs and install Rasbian. Testing proved it was the operating system causing the issue and I moving onto to test the next image likely to work, “Kali Linus RaspberryPi 2 and 3”. 

Tried to connect to router right out of the box without any setup. No luck with common protocols. Did not try any WPS though. Might explore later. Interestingly, the SSIDs I gave it during setup were not what the homepage they were after setup was complete. 

Connections refused out of box:
