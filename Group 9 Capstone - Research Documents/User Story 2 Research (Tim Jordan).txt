	Below you will find a link to the CVE details website.  This is a website I found through researching for potential vulnerabilities present in the router that we will be working with (the asus rt-ac68u) for this project.  This massive vulnerability databse seems like it will be very useful to us concerning the present vulnerabilities in the rt-ac68u wireless router.  This website is particularly nice because it is not just limited to the hardware we are using, but rather an enourmous database for numerous products from all kinds of different vendors/companies.
